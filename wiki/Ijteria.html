				<b>Ijteria</b> is a country located on <a>Andersia</a>, in Northern <a>Leskomia</a>. It shares land borders with <a>Austeria</a>
				<br>to the east, <a>???1</a> to the south-east, <a>Rumia</a> to the south, <a>Ferland</a> to the west and <a>???2</a> to the
				<br>north-west. Its capital and largest city is <a>Beravja</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Inhabited since at least the [name] Era, it is populated predominantly by the <a>Andersian</a> <a>Ijters</a>, (%98.2) as well
				<br>as <a>Rumians</a>, <a>Fers</a> (%1.6) and <a>Humans</a> (%0.2), the latter of which being chiefly research personel.

			<h2>Culture</h2>
			<p>
				While Leskomia saw less migrations and less contact between populations as would be expected of most Human nations, the continuous
				<br>presence of the Andersian Ijters in the territory of present-day Ijteria for millenia has allowed the country to benefit from 
				<br>a deep and very rich culture.
