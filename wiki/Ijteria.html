			<h2>Culture</h2>
			<p>
				While Leskomia saw less migrations and less contact between populations as would be expected of
				<br>most Human nations, the continuous presence of the Andersian Ijters in the territory of
				<br>present-day Ijteria for millenia has allowed the country to benefit from a deep and extraordinarily
				<br>rich culture.
